    Purdue Neurological Group (PNG) is involved in many different research projects, one of which involves measuring the 
    effects of head trama in athletics. More specifically, football helmet collisions. The goal of the project in reguards 
    to this repository is to design and implement high-speed data collection circuitry to measure the forces that take place 
    during one of these football impacts (tackles). "Data collection circuitry" refers to the following:
      * A microcontroller to read in analog inputs through an ADC
      * Variable resistance strain guages to measure forces
      * Analog multiplexers to route 6 different signals into the microcontroller
      * Differential amplifier / wheatstone bridge to convert the sensor resistance changes into changes in voltage.
      * SD card to record the data

    My contribution to this effort is the design and program this force collecting circuitry.  There has been a long history
    for this project that can be seen [here](https://github.com/MArndt26/PNG_Datalogger#project-history).

    The purpose of this project is to implement a serial parsing microcontroller system to operate the steering,
    throttle, and braking functionality of the Autonomous Motorsport Purdue (AMP) go-kart. Autonomous racing has
    grown in popularity as more teams work to solve the unique problem of autonomous decision making at very high
    speeds.  Our sub-team is working with the low-level electrical hardware on our modified go-kart, mainly focusing
    on parsing data from the onboard computer and distributing signals to other electronics such as the motor controller,
    linear actuator, and servos. To do this, the microcontroller receives custom serial packets from the go kartâ€™s
    computer to enable and then control the steering angle, throttle intensity, and brake position. The steering angle
    is set with a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal from the microcontroller.  The throttle is controlled via the digital
    to analog converter (DAC) and the braking is set via digital signals. To reduce processing time the serial structure
    was designed to use byte long data instead of floating-point values because the microcontroller does not have dedicated
    floating-point hardware. Furthermore, we implemented various error handling methods for packet transmission such as
    cyclic redundancy check. This project is currently in its initial testing phase. We are testing the integration of our
    subsystems by controlling the serial input using a custom javascript-based simulator. The ultimate goal of this project
    is to have a fully autonomous go-kart that can navigate any track environment at the maximum speed possible.
