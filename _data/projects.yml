    Purdue Neurological Group (PNG) is involved in many different research projects, one of which involves measuring the 
    effects of head trama in athletics. More specifically, football helmet collisions. The goal of the project in reguards 
    to this repository is to design and implement high-speed data collection circuitry to measure the forces that take place 
    during one of these football impacts (tackles). "Data collection circuitry" refers to the following:
      * A microcontroller to read in analog inputs through an ADC
      * Variable resistance strain guages to measure forces
      * Analog multiplexers to route 6 different signals into the microcontroller
      * Differential amplifier / wheatstone bridge to convert the sensor resistance changes into changes in voltage.
      * SD card to record the data

    My contribution to this effort involves designing and programing the force collecting circuitry.  There is a long history
    for this project that can be seen [here](https://github.com/MArndt26/PNG_Datalogger#project-history).

    This Project is used to interface with the microcontroller for the Autonomous Motorsport Purdue go kart. A key issue 
    for the AMP team is the allocation of resources between the subteams.  Due to the tight integration
    of our systems, both Electrical and Software sub-teams require access to the kart's main computer (Nvidia Jetson)
    and the electrical controller (Arduino MCU) for development/debugging tasks.  To solve this issue, I created 
    this Jetson Serial Simulator program.  This software takes the place of the Jetson which allows for full electrical
    integration testing, without the need to schedule time with the physical Jetson computer.

    Arduino based microntroller program for controlling low level electronics of autonomous go kart
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The purpose of this project is to implement a serial parsing microcontroller system to operate the steering,
    throttle, and braking functionality of the Autonomous Motorsport Purdue (AMP) go-kart. Autonomous racing has
    grown in popularity as more teams work to solve the unique problem of autonomous decision making at very high
    speeds.  Our sub-team is working with the low-level electrical hardware on our modified go-kart, mainly focusing
    on parsing data from the onboard computer and distributing signals to other electronics such as the motor controller,
    linear actuator, and servos. To do this, the microcontroller receives custom serial packets from the go kartâ€™s
    computer to enable and then control the steering angle, throttle intensity, and brake position. The steering angle
    is set with a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal from the microcontroller.  The throttle is controlled via the digital
    to analog converter (DAC) and the braking is set via digital signals. To reduce processing time the serial structure
    was designed to use byte long data instead of floating-point values because the microcontroller does not have dedicated
    floating-point hardware. Furthermore, we implemented various error handling methods for packet transmission such as
    cyclic redundancy check. This project is currently in its initial testing phase. We are testing the integration of our
    subsystems by controlling the serial input using a custom javascript-based simulator. The ultimate goal of this project
    is to have a fully autonomous go-kart that can navigate any track environment at the maximum speed possible.

    Automated Control System for Display Adheasive Dispenser
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This Project is used to create a control pad and scale to dispense adhesive until a weight limit is reached.
    E3 Displays uses various manufacturing processes when fabricating the customized display stacks for its customers.
    One of these processes involves using precise amounts of adhesive for bonding displays to cover glass.  In the past,
    this has been a manual process, requiring operators to spend large amounts of time preparing the adhesive for the bonding
    process.  This project automates this by bundling all the prep work into one location, controlled electronically.
