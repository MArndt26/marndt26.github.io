  I am an undergraduate student at <mark>Purdue University</mark> studying <mark>Electrical Engineering</mark> with a minor in Computer Science.  
  I am intensely curious about ASIC design and embedded system development.  I have had experience in microcontroller development across multiple
  systems including <mark>ESP32</mark>, <mark>Arduino</mark>, <mark>STM32</mark>, <mark>Teensy</mark>.

  I enjoy programming clean and intuitive applications for assisting in engineering projects, solving business problems, and sometimes just for fun!
  I have worked with many different languages including: <mark>C</mark>, <mark>C++</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>JavaFX</mark>, 
  <mark>Nodejs</mark>, <mark>Typescript</mark>, <mark>Arduino</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>MatLab</mark>.

  To assist in my electrical projects I use many engineering tools such as <mark>System Verilog</mark>, <mark>Git/GitHub</mark>, <mark>KiCad</mark>, 
  <mark>STM CubeMX</mark>, <mark>LTspice</mark>, <mark>QuestaSim</mark>, <mark>Design Compiler</mark>.
